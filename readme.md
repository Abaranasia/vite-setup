## Basic setup for a Vite based project

### Initial setup
1. Go to shell and write: ```npm create vite```. Then follow the instructions to create a project with the desired flavour. For this example I took vanilla javascript
2. Enter your project folder and type ```npm install``` and eventually ```npm run dev``` to serve it locally
